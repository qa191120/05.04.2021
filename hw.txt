1.
Create a table using this query:
create table Customer
(
	Id integer not null
		constraint Customer_pk
			primary key autoincrement,
	Firstname text not null,
	Lastname text not null,
	Numberoforders int not null,
	Height real not null
);

2. 
Insert 5 records with data as you choose

3.
Create class Customer (with all the peoprties identical to the table) [POJO]
+ToString

4.
[like we did in class. see demo code]
Create a CustomerDAO with these methods executes:
selectQuery (String query) : void (prints result to screen)
updateQuery (String query) : void (print how many records were update into the screen)
getAllCustomers () : ArrayList<Customer>
*etgar: getCustomerById (int id) : Customer -- will return the customer with the specific given id

5.
[like we did in class. see demo code]
From Main:
call selectQuery ("Select * from Customers")
call updateQuery ("Update customers set Numberoforders = Numberoforders + 1 where id > 0")
call getAllCustomers, then print the results using iterator
*etgar use Scanner to get an integer number from the user then get the Customer with the specific id given as input

6.
implement Comparable in Customer (by Lastname)
call getAllCustomers, now sort (by comparable) + print using iterator

7.
create Comparator to sort by number of orders
call getAllCustomers, now sort (by the comparator) + print using iterator
